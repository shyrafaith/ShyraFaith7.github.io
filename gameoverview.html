        <p>MOBA is an acronym for "Multiplayer Online Battle Arena." MOBA is a video game genre that mixes real-time strategy (RTS) and role-playing games (RPGs) into a competitive multiplayer experience. Players take control of a single character known as a hero or champion and work as a team to destroy the enemy team's base while defending their own. The goal is to advance across the map's lanes, overcoming obstacles and destroying computer-controlled minions and opponent players. MOBA games place a premium on cooperation, strategy, and team coordination. MOBA games that are popular include League of Legends (LoL), Dota 2, and Heroes of the Storm. These games have grown in popularity and spawned competitive esports communities, with professional players and organized tournaments attracting enormous crowds.</p>
